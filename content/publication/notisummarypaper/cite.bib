abstract = {To help users manage the overwhelming influx of smartphone notifications, this study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate notification summaries. We developed an Android application that integrates ChatGPT to summarize notifications and conducted an in-the-wild deployment to examine how users guided the model. To further understand user expectations for LLM-generated summaries, we interviewed 20 participants following a week-long engagement with the app. Our findings reveal five main strategies that users employed in their prompts for generating summaries. Additionally, interviewees expected summaries to prioritize three types of notifications, preferred three levels of information disclosure influenced by content anticipation and perceived criticality, and used three different approaches to synthesizing notifications based on their interrelationships. Finally, interviewees envisioned notification summarization functioning like a virtual assistant, desiring capabilities beyond simple information condensation, including support for task and information management, revisiting archived content, and tracking activities for reflection.},
