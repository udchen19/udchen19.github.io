Uei-Dar Chen is a post-baccalaureate research assistant at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (Taiwan). His interests lie in the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, specifically on intelligent agents that support personal information management, and using long-term personal data to prompt reflections on real-life behavior changes. Working with [Prof. Yung-Ju (Stanley) Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at the Mobile Ubiquitous Interaction (MUI) Lab, Uei-Dar currently leads the project of a RAG-based smartphone notification system that dynamically adapts to users‚Äô preferences via human-in-the-loop feedback and prompts reflection by presenting visualizations of LLM-learned preferences.
