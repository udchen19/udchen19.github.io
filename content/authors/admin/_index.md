Uei-Dar Chen is a research assistant whose interests lie in the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, specifically on how to support user's attention when retrieving and acting upon information when interacting with everyday devices. Working with [Dr. Yung-Ju (Stanley) Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at the Mobile Ubiquitous Interaction (MUI) Lab, his recent works focused on evaluating user experiences while provided a GPT-generated text summary of smartphone notifications, and it could be tweaked to meet individual preferences on glancing information in different scenarios.

**We are recently looking for undergraduates in NYCU CS to join our research project. If you're interested in Android/Kotlin development, generative AI, or HCI research in general, feel free to email or DM me on social media platforms!**
